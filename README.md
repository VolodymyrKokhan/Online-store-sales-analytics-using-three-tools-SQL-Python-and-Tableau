# Online store sales analytics using three tools: SQL, Python and Tableau
This project aims to analyze the operations of an online company over a three-month period. Throughout the project, we will create a dataset using an SQL query to a BigQuery database, then perform exploratory analysis and statistical research using Python methods. In the end, conclusions will be drawn and a dashboard will be created using Tableau.
